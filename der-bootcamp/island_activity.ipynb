    "# Islanding Considerations in DER Integration\n",
    "A common sticking point around DER integration on distribution feeders is focused on unintentional islands.\n",
    "The basic concern is that if a fault occurs on the feeder, the breaker at the distribution substation opens to isolate the fault, but the DER on the feeder fails to detect the island and continues to feed the fault, at risk to both equipment and people.\n",
    "\n",
    "The [i2X solution e-Xchange](https://www.energy.gov/eere/i2x/i2x-solution-e-xchanges) _Distribution System Protection with High DER Adoption Levels_ (Grid Engineering Practices & Standards) discussed this topic on May 3rd, 2023; the event was [recorded](https://youtu.be/haGZQfdPp1E) and is recommended viewing material for this exercise.\n",
    "It discusses, among many other things, the use of the [Sandia Screen](https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1039001) and other alternatives to Direct Transfer Trip (DTT), which is an expensive and complex communications based solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this exercise is to show how islanding consideration _could_ be incorporated into hosting capacity analysis, and how the use of time-series based methods can provide new ways of thinking about screening for the problem.\n",
    "This is _not_ intended to be taken as _the_ solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Approach to screening for potential islanding\n",
    "The basic concept put forth in the [Sandia Screen](https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1039001) is that for an island to occur there needs to be both a real and reactive power balance at the time of the fault.\n",
    "Building on this idea in the simulations, we monitor the flow on all reclosers in the system (this could be extended to other switching/protection devices if desired).\n",
    "These devices are used to segment the feeder into components that are the potential islands.\n",
    "The net flow in/out of each one of these is monitored via the following set of tests:\n",
    "The following test is then carried out:\n",
    "1. Is the potential island always importing or exporting _real power_?\n",
    "\t* Yes -> test is passed\n",
    "\t* No  -> proceed to step 2\n",
    "2. Is the ratio of minimum output to maximum output above a certain level? Idea here is that the larger this ratio, the more abrupt the transition between importing to exporting and the less likely the load balance condition is met for any meaningful amount of time.\n",
    "\t* Yes -> test is passed\n",
    "\t* No  -> proceed to step 3\n",
    "3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 for _reactive power_\n",
    "\n",
    "## Visualizing components\n",
    "The code to visualize the separable components of the feeders is provided in the auxiliary [feederplots notebook](./feederplots.ipynb).\n",
    "The feeder plots themselves are available in the [feederplots](./feederplots/) folder.\n",
    "The rest of the exercise will occasionally refer to a component number, the figures ending with `Comp.html` can help clarify what is referred to with each component."

    "## With Inverter Mode `VOLT_VAR_CATB`\n",
    ">**IMPORTANT:**<br>\n",
    ">Make sure to begin this sequence by setting `inverter_choice=\"VOLT_VAR_CATB\"` in [Step 1](#step-1-choose-inverter-function-and-initialize).\n",
    "### Sequence of Events\n",
    "* On the **first (1)** iteration \n",
    "    * Several thermal violations are remedied.\n",
    "    * Adjustment of the voltage regulator is sufficient to resolve the over-voltage violation\n",
    "* On the **second (2)** iteration\n",
    "    * Several more thermal violations are remedied.\n",
    "    * Following these, the only violation remaining is the islanding violation. Run the [island plot code cell](#plotting)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Observations\n",
    "Even though the islanding test is binding in the end, a closer look at the results reveals how this is still just a screen.\n",
    "Namely, while both component 0 (bottom of the feeder) and component 2 (exchange with substation) have a $P$ and a $Q$ zero crossing, the two don't actually coincide exactly in time.\n",
    "This fits with some of the observations mentioned in the [i2X Solution e-Xchange](https://www.energy.gov/eere/i2x/i2x-solution-e-xchanges) on the subject, where only a relatively small fraction of plants failing an anti-islanding screen actually display anti-islanding issues upon further study and therefore require DTT.\n",
    "\n",
    "## With Inverter Mode `CONSTANT_PF`\n",
    ">**IMPORTANT:**<br>\n",
    ">Make sure to begin this sequence by setting `inverter_choice=\"CONSTANT_PF\"` in [Step 1](#step-1-choose-inverter-function-and-initialize).\n",
    "### Sequence of Events\n",
    "* On the **first (1)** iteration\n",
    "    * Several thermal violations are remedied.\n",
    "    * Adjustment of the voltage regulator is sufficient to resolve the over-voltage violation\n",
    "* On the **second (2)** iteration\n",
    "    * Several more thermal violations are remedied, following which both a voltage maximum and the islanding constraints are being violated.\n",
    "    * This time the over-voltage violations are upstream of the regulator and the substation transformer tabs are adjusted. This adjustment not only resolves the over-voltage problem, but the island constraint is also lifted.\n",
    "* On the **third (3)** iteration\n",
    "    * A thermal violation is remedied.\n",
    "    * The over-voltage violation is now on both sides of the regulator, so both voltage regulator and transformer taps are adjusted.\n",
    "    * An under-voltage violation now crops up\n",
    "\n",
    "Feel free to play around more with the settings and see if you can resolve the issue.\n",
    "For example, you can restart at the [Over-Voltage Violations](#over-voltage-violations) section, which reloads the feeder prior to the last modificaitions, and try to change the number of taps the substation transformer will be shifted.  \n",
    "There are also example cells in the [Backup](#backup) section that perform further conductor upgrades.\n",
    "Utilize the [plots](#voltage-minmax-plotting) to try get a feel for where, when, and to what extent the voltage violations are occurring.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Observations\n",
    "While the violations _may_ be resolvable with sufficient upgrades on the third iteration, the more important aspect of this exercise is that the anti-islanding constraint does not play a decisive role in limiting capacity with this control mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Comparison\n",
    "Compare the plot for component 0, $P$ and $Q$ for the case with `VOLT_VAR_CATB` vs. `CONSTANT_PF`.\n",
    "With `VOLT_VAR_CATB`, when generation increases during the middle of the day, the reactive power moves in the opposite direction to help steady the voltage.\n",
    "As a result, a change in direction occurs with both real and reactive power, leading to the possibility of unintentional load balance.\n",
    "With `CONSTANT_PF`, on the other hand, there is far less variation in the reactive power, and as a result the change in direction does not occur.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Plotting\n",
    "## Islanding Plot\n",
    "At any point during the exercise, you can run the cell below to create a plot of feeder component import/export to try to understand why the metric is behaving the way it is.\n",
    "Definitely run this if the only active violation is the islanding one, but occasionally looking at this even if it is not binding can be helpful."
