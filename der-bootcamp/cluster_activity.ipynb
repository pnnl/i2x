    "1. _Capacity Prorated_: the costs are distributed based on the share of total cluster capacity that the resource represents.\n",
    "2. _Sensitivity Based_: For each resource, we'll investigate how a $\\Delta P$ of capacity impacts the magnitude of violation x $\\Delta x$. The sensitity is $\\Delta x/\\Delta P$ and for a unitized $\\Delta P$ gives us the comparative impact this particular resource has. The share of cost will be assessed accordingly."
